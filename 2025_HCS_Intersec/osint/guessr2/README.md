## The challenge

It's a no-walk geoguessr-type of challenge. It spawns me on a pedestrian surrounded with art-deco buildings. Signs with cyrillic letters can be found all around. People mostly wear winter-suit(?) although its clear.

I can already guess it's most likely in Russia.

## How to solve?

Since the letters found are mostly cyrillics, I just used GoogleLens to find the information. I used Google Lense on the statue of a man.

It shows that this statue belongs to Eugene Vakhtangov Monument in Moscow, Russia. Let's visit the place on Google Maps.

It's very likely that it is the place. Without further ado, let's pinpoint the exact spot!
