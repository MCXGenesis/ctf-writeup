>can you find out where this is before gta 6 released?

## The challenge
It's a no-walk geoguessr-type of challenge. It spawns me in a road in the middle of a swampy place. It has a cloudy weather and lots of vegetation, might be humid too. On one side, there are mountainous terrain. It's almost certain that this is a tropical place.

Meanwhile on the other side, there are also some terrain but with a noticable tall building.

There are also few village and residential area round this place. And on the side of the road there is a road signing `ĐT 317G`.

## How to solve?
As it is hard to find a clue, the best chance is to look up on the `ĐT 317G`. Searching it up on google with `DT 317G' keyword does not provide a clear result.

This road seems to be following next to a river with villages on the side of the road. But I am looking for a swampy-lakey area. Let's look up for that area alongside the road.

It turns out that this road does not have any swampy area alongside it. But there is an area that looked alike.

When I tried to street view, it shows the certain given area as shown on the chall. The mountaineous terrain and the tall building can be seen. So, I just need to pinpoint alongside the road. And ...
